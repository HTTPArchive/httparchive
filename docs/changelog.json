Prior to Oct 1 2012 the tests were configured to stop at document complete. However, lazy loading resources (loading them dynamically after window.onload) has grown in popularity. Therefore, this setting was changed so that these post-onload requests would be captured. This resulted in more HTTP requests being recorded with a subsequent bump in transfer size."

In the Nov 15 2013 crawl about 7.5% of websites were tested with IE11. Although this affected some results, the impact was judged to be minimal so we left the data intact. In the Dec 1 2013 crawl about 47% of websites were tested with IE11. This had a dramatic affect on results with a 10x increase in failures and a drop from 71% to 34% in responses gzipped. (We are not sure what produced that change.) Because the results changed so significantly the data from the Dec 1 2013 crawl was removed."
