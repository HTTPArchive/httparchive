// This file is currently meant to be run manually every month or so.
// The purpose is to free up disk space taken up by rows in the 
// "requests" and "requestsdev" tables. We do NOT need these rows for
// any part of the UI, and all of the requests are archived in a dump
// file for each crawl. I'm too nervous to delete the rows automatically
// as part of the crawl process. Instead, once everything looks okay,
// I run this script manually.
